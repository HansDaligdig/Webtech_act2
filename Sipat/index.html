        <h1>What is Sipat?</h1>
        <p>Sipat is a term used in the Cordillera that means an exchange of tokens. 
            It is a part of the indigenous way of settling a disagreement known as “Bodong” as the initial stage of the process.

        <h1>The Mount Data Peace Accord (CAR Sipat)</h1>
        <p>On September 13, 1986, the Mount Data Peace Accord, also known as the Sipat Agreement or simply Sipat, 
            was a peace agreement formed by the Cordillera People's Liberation Army (CPLA) and the Philippine government. 
            The group’s leader, Fr. Conrad Balweg, met with former president Corazon “Cory” Aquino at the Mount Data Hotel in Bauko, 
            Mountain Province. This agreement led to the foundation of the Cordillera Administrative Region and through Proclamation No. 
            324, has declared the date to be a special holiday within the region.

                      Philippines – New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) due to differing beliefs and goals;

                      traditions. With the support of the tribal elders, Balweg formed the Cordillera
